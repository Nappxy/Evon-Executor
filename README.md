# Model-Downgrade
Downgrades Roblox v2.00 (bin) meshes to v1.00 (ascii) in Java

### What is this?

It takes Roblox's new 2.00 version .mesh file and parses it into Java objects. 
You can use this code to simply downgrade a model to version 1.00 (for any reason), to
create your own new mesh format, or to learn about Roblox's mesh structure.

You can use this code for whatever you want as long as you link back to this repository.
